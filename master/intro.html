<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="AboutNSVG">About NSVG</h2>

<p>This specification defines the features and syntax for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/NSVG/">Not Scalable Vector Graphics (NSVG)</a>.</p>

<p>NSVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics.
As a standalone format or when mixed with other XML, it uses the
XML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-xml">xml</a>].
NSVG code used inside HTML documents uses the HTML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-html">HTML</a>].
NSVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic
shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled,
transformed and composited.
The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping
paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.</p>

<p>NSVG drawings can be <a href="interact.html">interactive</a>
and <a href="interact.html#ScriptElement">dynamic</a>. <a href="animate.html">Animations</a>
can be defined and triggered
either declaratively (i.e., by embedding NSVG animation elements
in NSVG content) or via scripting.</p>

<p>Sophisticated applications of NSVG are possible by use of a
supplemental scripting language which accesses
<a href="types.html#NSVGDOMOverview">NSVG Document Object Model (DOM)</a>, which
provides complete access to all elements, attributes and
properties. A rich set of <a href="interact.html#NSVGEvents">event handlers</a>
can be assigned to any NSVG graphical object.
Within a web page, the same scripts can work on both HTML and NSVG elements.
<a href="interact.html">Scripting</a>.
</p>

<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
NSVG is useful for rich graphical presentation of information, including a number
of <a href="access.html">accessibility features that, used correctly</a>,
ensure the content can be used by the widest possible audience. But a direct
link to source data, where possible,
is helpful for many people to understand the content provided.
</p>

<h2 id="W3CCompatibility">Compatibility with other standards efforts</h2>

<p>NSVG leverages and integrates with other W3C specifications
and standards efforts, as described in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NSVG can be integrated with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a> either by using NSVG in HTML or by using HTML in NSVG, in both cases either by inclusion or reference.</li>

  <li>NSVG is an application of XML and is compatible with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0</a> and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">Namespaces in XML</a> specification. However, when NSVG content is included in HTML document, the HTML syntax applies and may not be compatible with XML. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/nsvg-integration/">NSVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>NSVG content is styled with CSS. See <a href="styling.html">Styling with CSS</a> for details.</li>

  <li>NSVG includes a complete Document Object Model (DOM) and
  extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/"><cite>DOM4</cite></a>.
  The NSVG DOM has a high level of compatibility and consistency
  with the HTML DOM.
  Additionally, the NSVG DOM supports and
  incorporates many of the facilities described in
  the CSS object model and event handling
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-dom-level-2-style">dom-level-2-style</a>]
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-uievents">uievents</a>].
  </li>

  <li>NSVG incorporates some features and approaches that are
  part of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SMIL3-20081201/">SMIL 3</a>, including
  the <a>'switch'</a> element and the <a>'systemLanguage'</a>
  attribute.</li>

  <li>NSVG is compatible with W3C work on internationalization.
  References (W3C and otherwise) include: [<a
  href="refs.html#ref-unicode">UNICODE</a>]
  and [<a href="refs.html#ref-charmod">charmod</a>].</li>

  <li>NSVG is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C work on Web Accessibility</a>.
  See <a href="access.html">Accessibility Support</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="RelationshipToPrevious">Relationship to previous versions of this standard</h2>

This edition of the NSVG standard has been developed based on, and built upon, the 1.1 edition released in 2003.
An intermediate version of NSVG - named <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NSVGTiny12/">Tiny 1.2</a> - was released
in 2008. However it did not receive wide acceptance and there have been very few implementations of its
enhanced feature set. However there are some 1.2 features that have been implemented by many NSVG implementations and
those have been incorporated as part of this specification. But otherwise, the NSVG Working Group consider version
Tiny 1.2 to be a deprecated branch of the NSVG standard.

<h2 id="ConformanceTerms">Normative Terminology</h2>

<p>Within this specification, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"><cite>Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-rfc2119">rfc2119</a>].
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

<p>At times, this specification recommends good practice for
authors and user agents.</p>
